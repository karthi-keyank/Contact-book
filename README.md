# solution for errors
- case sensitive for names 
- so enter all in caps or small letters
- if can't make outgoing call
try this points
- enter contact number with + and country code
- example +91
- number should be entere with out space
- example +911234567890
- don't enter like this
- +91 1234567890 or +91 12345 67890
- if you still seeing error make issue
